Roman numerals are based on seven symbols:
 				  
| Symbol | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1,000 |
 
Numbers are formed by combining symbols together and adding the values. 

> For example, 
> MMVI is 1000 + 1000 + 5 + 1 = 2006. 

Generally, symbols are placed in order of value, starting with the largest values.
When smaller values precede larger values, the smaller values are subtracted from
the larger values, and the result is added to the total. 

> For example,
> MCMXLIV = 1000 + (1000 − 100) + (50 − 10) + (5 − 1) = 1944.
 
- The symbols "I", "X", "C", and "M" can be repeated three times in succession, but
no more. (They may appear four times if the third and fourth are separated by a smaller value, such as XXXIX.) 
- "D", "L", and "V" can never be repeated.
- "I" can be subtracted from "V" and "X" only.
- "X" can be subtracted from "L" and "C" only.
- "C" can be subtracted from "D" and "M" only. 
- "V", "L", and "D" can never be subtracted.
- Only one small-value symbol may be subtracted from any large-value symbol.
- A number written in Arabic numerals can be broken into digits.
